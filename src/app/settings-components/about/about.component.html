      Bolero is a self-hosted, visually stunning start page designed to bring elegance, order, and power to your digital workspace. Inspired by the crescendo of Ravel’s famous composition, Bolero transforms the browser homepage into a crescendo of form and functionality—intuitive, organized, and deeply customizable.
   </p>
   <p>
      Built using Angular and NestJS, Bolero features a robust full-stack architecture backed by SQLite for efficient local data storage. Every element—from categories and link groups to icons, themes, and background images—is designed with user experience in mind, offering a seamless interface for managing, styling, and launching your most-used web resources.

   <app-small-title title="Hierarchical Organization"></app-small-title>
   Bolero structures your links in a three-tier hierarchy:<br/><br/>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Link Categories: </b>Broad organizational groups (e.g., Work, Personal, Dev Tools).</li>
      <li><b>Link Groups: </b>Subsections within categories, useful for grouping by project, topic, or tool type.</li>
      <li><b>Links</b>: Each link includes a title, URL, description, icon, and tags—fully editable and reorderable via intuitive drag-and-drop.</li>
   </ul>
   <app-small-title title="Powerful Features"></app-small-title>
